# Artificial Neural Network Project
## Description

## Getting Started
This version was designed for python 3.6.6 or higher. To run the model's calculation, it is only needed to execute the file `run.py`. On the terminal, the command is `python run.py`.

## Prerequisites
### Libraries
The following librairies are used:
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) 1.14.3, can be obtained through [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), also available through anaconda
* [keras](https://keras.io/): `pip install Keras`
* [tensor flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/): `pip install tensorflow`

### Code
