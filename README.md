# Artificial Neural Network Project
## Learning to play Pong with Deep Reinforcement Learning
### Description
In this project, we explore and understand the different deep reinforcement learning methods in order to train a Pong player. The methods exposed in this project are reinforcement, reinforcement with baseline and Actor-Critic network.

### Getting Started
This version was designed for python 3.6.6 or higher. To run the model's calculation, it is only needed to execute the file `miniproject_rl.ipynb`.

### Prerequisites
#### Libraries
The following librairies are used:
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) 1.14.3, can be obtained through [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), also available through anaconda
* [keras](https://keras.io/): `pip install Keras`
* [tensor flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/): `pip install tensorflow`
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/users/installing.html): `python -m pip install -U matplotlib`
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news): `pip3 install pygame`
* [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/): `pip3 install Pillow` 
* [PyGame Learning Environment](https://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
```git clone https://github.com/ntasfi/PyGame-Learning-Environment
cd PyGame-Learning-Environment
pip3 install -e .
```

### Additional Content
